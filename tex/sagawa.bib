  abstract =   "Labradorescence is a complex optical phenomenon that can be
               found in certain minerals, such as Labradorite or
               Spectrolite. Because of their unique colour properties these
               minerals are often used  as gemstones and decorative
               objects. Since the phenomenon is strongly orientation
               dependent, such minerals need a special cut to make the most
               of their unique type of colourful sheen, which makes it
               desirable to be able to predict the final appearance of a
               given stone prior to the cutting process. Also, the peculiar
               properties of the effect make a believable replication with
               an ad-hoc shader dificult even for normal, non-predictive
               rendering purposes.  We provide a reflectance model for
               labradorescence that is directly derived from the physical
               characteristics of such materials. Due to its inherent
               accuracy, it can be used for predictive rendering purposes,
               but also for generic rendering applications. ",
